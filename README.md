# data-distribute
a go practice project, also used in my work

use beego build base service, gopher-lua run lua scripts(https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua)

client submit a report to the data-distribute platform, and this report needs to be distributed to different customers,

each customer has its own API, so I use lua scripts to handle these calls
